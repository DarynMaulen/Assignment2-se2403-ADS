ðŸ“ŒThis project contains custom implementations of common data structures in Java. It was created as part of Assignment 2 for the Algorithms and Data Structures course.

ðŸ”¹IMPLEMENTED DATA STRUCTURES:

MyArrayList<T> â€” Custom implementation of a dynamic array.

MyLinkedList<T> â€” Custom implementation of a doubly linked list.

MyStack<T> â€” Stack implementation using a list.

MyQueue<T> â€” Queue implementation using a list.

MyMinHeap<T extends Comparable<T>> â€” Min-heap implementation using a list.

ðŸ”¹KEY FEATURES:

Each data structure supports standard operations (add, remove, get, set, etc.).

The min-heap supports insert, getMin, and extractMin methods with proper heap properties.

All generic classes use type parameters for flexibility.

Code is separated into interfaces and implementation classes for better modularity.

ðŸ”¹TESTING:

All data structures are tested in the ResulTest.java class.

Example inputs and expected outputs are printed to the console.

You can run ResulTest.java to verify the functionality of all components.

ðŸ”¹FOLDER STRUCTURE:

interfaces/ â€” contains interfaces like IMyStack, IMyQueue, IMyMinHeap, MyList, etc.

Implementation classes: MyArrayList.java, MyLinkedList.java, MyStack.java, MyQueue.java, MyMinHeap.java.

Main.java â€” optional main entry (if needed).

ResulTest.java â€” contains all test cases for each structure.
